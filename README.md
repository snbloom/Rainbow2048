# Rainbow2048
AP Comp Sci Final Project 2018

This is my final project from the first coding class I ever took, as a junior in high school. 
I spent many hours on it, and the feeling of fulfilment I got when I finally got it working is what inspired me to pursue CS!
It is a copycat 2048 game, except with colors of the rainbow instead of numbers. 
Enjoy!
